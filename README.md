# ESP32-CONNECTION
Using Arduino IDE and html with JavaScript, in a web page, connected to a server in the 80 port, we send trough a button a function to active on Arduino IDE.

A robotic mechanism has been developed to control the movement of a figure tracing instrument on a plane using two servo motors, and a third servo motor to control the mechanism and elevation in the z-axis. The working area of the mechanism is 50 cm2. The user controls the mechanism through a web application that presents a set of basic figures to select from. This mechanism allows for precise tracing of figures on the plane quickly and easily, making it suitable for educational and design applications.
